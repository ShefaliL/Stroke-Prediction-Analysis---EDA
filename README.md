 stroke:Output [1: Patient had a stroke ,0: Patient didn't have a stroke]

Research Questions:
Our project's aim is to visualize and comprehend the risk factors of stroke.
1) What are the attributes that are associated with stroke?
2) Can we perform Dimensionality reduction of this high dimension data by minimizing
information loss?
3) Will non-linear classifiers be more effective in predicting if an individual has a stroke
or not?
