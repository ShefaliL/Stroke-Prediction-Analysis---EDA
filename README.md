# Stroke-Prediction-Analysis---EDA

The dataset being used for the Final Project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset available on Kaggle. This
dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on various parameters.

Our project's aim is to visualize and comprehend the risk factors of stroke.
1) What are the attributes that are associated with stroke?
2) Can we perform Dimensionality reduction of this high dimension data by minimizing
information loss?
3) Will non-linear classifiers be more effective in predicting if an individual has a stroke
or not?
